# This is a simple example of a "safe" table.  It only translates 4 characters.
#
# The default is commented out, so any character that is not in this table will
# be ignored.

# default   _

#
# This is the main replacement block.  Each line specifies a character and a
# string to replace it with.

# Starts an optional, language-specific translation block.  detox will read
# your locale and load the block if the word after start matches the language
# portion of your locale.
#
# In the example here, the character $ will be replaced with "_money_" if the
# user is working in English.  If the user is using a different language, $
# will be replaced with the value configured in the previous block, "_dollar_".

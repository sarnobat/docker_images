  `detox` is a program that renames files to make them easier to work with
  under Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.  Spaces and various other
  unsafe characters (such as "`$`") get replaced with "`_`".  The upper portion
  of ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) can be transcoded to UTF-8, as can CP-1252.

# Mounting via Dockerfile
# This simply cannot be done. Docker images are designed to be portable. Host mounts are host specific. Thus if you are able to specify a host mount at build time, it will make the image non-portable across machine that don't have this mount folder. Thus this is why this option is not available.
# You can use docker compose to help the user not choose the mount folder.
